# Mat-TechLab's Standard Operating Procedures

Welcome to MattchLab's SOPs website. These SOPs refers to different protocols which data are collected simultaneously and that show very similar or overlapping procedures. These refers to several different protocols: 

- visual checkerboard fMRI protocol
- audio fMRI protocol 
- resting state audio-visual fMRI protocol. 

In the Data Collection section, the different protocols are extensively descripted. 



## Summary

Understanding how the brain's structure influences its distributed functions and processing dynamics holds great potential for revolutionizing neuroscience and clinical applications. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven to be a valuable, non-invasive tool for examining both the architecture and activity of the brain in vivo. Despite significant mathematical and computational advances in reconstructing resonance signals, most studies rely on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using echo-planar imaging (EPI). This method employs Cartesian sampling and image reconstruction with a direct one-to-one correspondence between the number of acquired volumes and reconstructed images. However, EPI techniques face trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolutions. In this project, we aim to overcome these limitations by measuring the BOLD signal using a gradient recalled echo (GRE) with a 3D radial-spiral phyllotaxis trajectory at a high sampling rate. This approach allows the reconstruction of 3D signal time courses with whole-brain coverage, achieving simultaneously higher spatial (1 mmÂ³) and temporal (up to 250 ms) resolutions compared to optimized EPI schemes. Additionally, artifacts are corrected before image reconstruction, and the desired temporal resolution can be selected post-scan without assumptions about the hemodynamic response shape. In total, each protocol involves MRI/fMRI acquisition from 20 healthy adult human subjects using three different 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI scanners available at CHUV.

## Impact
Overall, this project will introduce a new framework for acquiring and analyzing fMRI data, addressing many of the current limitations. This method represents a significant advancement in functional BOLD imaging and has the potential to fundamentally redefine the research questions fMRI can address regarding cognitive processes. The project will publicly release valuable datasets that are essential for enhancing the acquisition and analysis of functional resonance data. In conclusion, this study is poised to be a turning point for MRI research in both neuroscientific and clinical applications.
