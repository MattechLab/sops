## Data Collection audio fMRI protocol

#### Overall experimental setting
The experimental setup includes:
- *Syncbox:* A NordicLabs Syncbox receives TTL (transistor-transistor logic) triggers from the scanner. This box can forward the triggers converted into other formats and/or manipulate them (e.g., filter, generate, etc.).
- *Experimental laptop:* It is the laptop where the Psychopy software is installed and with it the task programs are executed. This laptop also stores the data recorded by the ET at the end of the experiment.

#### Three - One day before the session
- To verify that the Psychopy experiment runs correctly.
- To verify that all the tools necessary for the data collection run correctly.
- Print the informed consent form.
- Print the MRI safety screener (EN|FR).
- Print a receipt form for each participant that will get scanned.

#### Session preparation
The following section describes how to prepare the session on the day of the scan BEFORE the participant arrives. Try to arrive at the Control Room at least 30 min ahead of the session start time.

##### Setup Preparation Inside the Scanner room
- Memorize where the other tools for the recordings are to put those back in place at the end (coil, emergency button, ears cover).

###### Setting up the projector
- Before entering the scanner room, go to the room where the projector is installed.
- Switch the projector ON by hitting the power button located on its right side.
- Verify the aim of the projector's beam by looking through the tube into the Scanning Room.
- Verify the projection corresponds to the Psychopy laptop screen.
- Go to the scanner room and take the half-circle one-direction screen from the table behind the scanner and put it on the back of the scanner.

###### Setting up the coils
- If any head coil from the last exam is still plugged, remove it:
  - If it is the 64-channel coil, you can just temporarily move it into the scanner's bore.
  - Otherwise, store it on the shelf where the other coils are and bring the 64-channel one in the proximity of the bed (e.g., inside the scanner's bore). Make sure to remove other coil's fitting elements.
- Remove the spine coil by lifting the corresponding latch, then sliding it toward the head of the bed, lift it from the bed and place it on the floor ensuring it is not obstructing any passage or unstable.
- Place the two back padding elements filling the spine coil socket.
- Place the 64-channel head-and-neck coil into its socket at the head end of the bed.

###### Final setting inside the scanning room
- Cover the MRI bed with a clean sheet.
- Prepare padding: under-knee padding, neck-and-head padding, under-elbows padding, head-sides padding, top-head wedge padding.
  - Wrap a sanitary cover around each ear cover.
  - Place a double neck-and-head padding inside the coil if necessary.
- Prepare a blanket to cover the participant.

##### Setup Preparation Inside the Control Room

###### Setting up experiment instruments
- Arrive to the Control Room at least 30 min ahead the session start time.
- Place the experimental laptop on the designed desk and connect all the as showed in the following picture (without eyelink ethernet). Specifically, connect the experimental laptop to:
  - Plug the power adaptor to the laptop, and the adaptor to the power outlet on the wall.
  - the screen switch box with the corresponding HDMI cable ( This should project your screen on the screen of CHUV's tower).
  - the audio switch box with the corresponding jack cable ( This should share your audio on the audio of CHUV's tower).
  - Connect the SyncBox to the laptop with the USB cable. It is normally plugged into CHUV's stimuli workstation, it must be re-plugged in there after the session.

#### Participant Preparation

##### Participant reception
- Meet the participant at an easily locatable place (e.g., the reception desk of the Radiology Unit) and show them the way into the control room. Allow sufficient time before the experiment for the preparation.
- Show the participant the scanning room and explain to them how the device is controlled from outside.
- Ask to the participant to fill out the consent form and MRI safety screener, and verbally confirm responses and discuss further doubts, paying attention to frequently forgotten devices and implants, like orthodontia.
- Remind the participant to use the bathroom at this moment if they need.
- Describe the participant how the session will develop and explain clearly the task. Let them interrupt you to ask for clarifications and answer all the questions that may arise.
???+ quote "Script for the session"
      “We are going to acquire two types of images. The first type is anatomical imaging that we use to study the morphology of the brain. The second type is a functional MRI, which we use to understand how the brain activates as a response to stimuli we will present to you. During the whole duration of the exam, please do not create closed loops by crossing your legs or holding your hands together. It is possible that your peripheral nerves get stimulated at some points, so you will feel twitching of muscles, for instance, of your pectorals. Do not panic, it is okay, but if it feels too uncomfortable, please squeeze the alarm button.For the anatomical MRI we just ask you to relax and try to stay as still and comfortable as possible. Like a photographic camera, the largest problem making analyses difficult is motion. As opposed to a photo camera, the imaging of the brain happens very slow so there is a lot of opportunity for involuntary movements (e.g., when you blink or you take a deeper breath) or semi-voluntary (e.g., you need to swallow).
	  During the functional MRI you will hear different sounds in the headphones. The audio stimulation consists of short sounds of objects of everyday life (es for example, the sound of vacuum cleaner, the crying of a child, a guitar song, a bell rings, etc.) or animal noises. The experimental protocol consists of 15s audio stimulation using the above tracks followed by 25s of pauses in which we provided a pink noise. For the entire period of the experiment you should takes the eye open on a fixation point (a red cross) at the center of a gray environment. The experiment has a duration of 40 minutes more and less.
	  
	  *Is everything clear to you? Do you have any questions?”

 
- Offer the participant a box to deposit everything they have in their pockets and all jewelry/hair accessories, and indicate the before to continue, we need to make sure we do not introduce any dangerous object in the magnet room. Therefore, it is important to inform the participant to remove every metallic accessory. 
- Ask to remove shoes at the entrance of the scanning room.

##### Participant preparation in the scanning room
- Instruct the participant to lay on the MRI bed and adjust the participant inside.
- Put the headphones on the ears.
- Give to the participant the emergency button. Make the participant try it, so they can see it works. To switch off the alarm, there’s a button on the scanner (circular, both on the left and on the right of the hole) 
- Once the previous part is insured, the participant is ready. If the participant is cold, put a blanket on top of him. 
- Connect the coil's cable to the corresponding socket on the table.
- Gently move the participant with the manual regulation. Stop when the head is under the head-localizer. Ask the participant to close the eyes, localize the head with the infrareds.
- Switch off the infrareds, now the participant can open the eyes. You can move the participant (always gently as before) inside the scanner, until the mm counter marks “Isometric”.
- If everything is ok, you can move forward and record.

##### Participant preparation in the scanning room
- Inform the participant that you are leaving the room and will now close the door to start. Let them also know that you are going to communicate with them very shortly to check that communications through the speaker are functioning.
- Exit the Scanning Room.
- Close the Scanning Room door.
