# Overall experimental setting
The experimental setting is to obtain anatomical MRI scan with synchronized eye tracking recording (the right eye gaze trajectories and eye movement events including blinking, saccades and fixation).

Here is the illustration of the overall experiment:

![](../assets/debi_protocol/overview/overall_setting.png){: style="width: 100%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

The graph above can be divided into the following components:
- Syncbox: A NordicLabs Syncbox sends TTL (transistor-transistor logic) triggers to the scanner and forward the signal converted to the keyboard signal "s" to the PsychoPy laptop.

- Scanner: 3T clinical scanner (MAGNETOM PrismaFit, Siemens Healthineers) with a 64-channel head-neck coil with an attached mirror.
- Eye tracker: We use the EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research Ltd.) for eye tracking.
  (i) The eye tracker consists of an infrared lens and camera sensor on one side, along with an infrared lamp to illuminate the subject's right eye. It is positioned inside the scanner bore.
  (ii) An infrared mirror is mounted on the head coil.
- The Eye Tracker PC is bi-directionally connected to both the eye tracker and the PsychoPy laptop. It receives eye tracking data from the tracker, processes the eye movement trajectories and images, calculates pupil sizes by segmenting the pupil area, and classifies eye movement events based on predefined thresholds. The ET PC also receives trigger and task event messages from the PsychoPy laptop, logs data, and sends both the eye tracking data and logs back to the PsychoPy laptop.
- Stimuli laptop (PsychoPy Laptop): The PsychoPy laptop runs the PsychoPy software, which is used to execute the task programs. These programs coordinate various hardware components, including the ET PC, eye tracker, the screen, and syncbox. In our DEBI experiment, the 'MR-Eye' protocol displays a central dot that changes color at a frequency of 10Hz. In the 'MREye-Track' protocol, a gray dot sequentially appears at the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen. The laptop also stores the data and logs generated by the Eye Tracker PC after the experiment.


# Session Preparation
## Configure the IP address
If you are connecting your PC to the eye tracker (ET) for the first time, you need to reconfigure the IP address.
On windows:
- Go to `Control Panel` -> `Network and Internet` -> `Network Connections`
- Double-click on the `Ethernet` connection.
- Select `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)` and click `Properties`.

<mark>what value is the default position of the screw for convenient focus ?</mark>
!!! tip "The default position of the screw for convenient focus is typically set to `1`. However, the exact value can vary depending on the specific participant and setup for each time. It's recommended to start with the screw at value `1` and adjust from there for optimal focus during setup. If you're following a specific SOP, it might provide additional details for your equipment."
![](../assets/debi_protocol/selected/11-install-lens-ET.png){: style="width: 80%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

### Place the infrared-mirror onto the head coil
- Detach the standard mirror's frame from the head coil, if it is placed there. 
- Take the infrared mirror out of the «fMRI usage» box. It should be always protected by a mask unless in use.
!!! warning "This infrared mirror is the most delicate part, because the morror cannot be replaced nor cleaned. This mirror is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE."
![](../assets/debi_protocol/selected/12-e-infered-mirror.png){: style="width: 80%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

- Get two gloves (e.g., from the box hanging at the entrance of the scanner room)
- Put the gloves on, and **DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING**. You must have the standard mirror dismounted and ahead of this step. 
- **WITH THE GLOVES** proceed to extract the infra-red mirror from its box, being extremely careful. **YOU CAN ONLY TOUCH THE MIRROR WITH GLOVES**, because it cannot be cleaned up. Watch out for FINGERPRINTS and once taken out of the protection mask, IMMEDIATELY AND CAREFULLY ATTACH IT to the head coil.
<mark>[A photo of the head coil with the mirror correctly installed is missing]</mark>
## Preparation in the scanner room

![](../assets/debi_protocol/selected/14-half-circle-screen.png){: style="width: 80%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}
### Place the participant
#### Place the subject on the bed
- Apply a blanket, ear plugs and sand bags to the participant.
- Adjust the head coil and the mirror. If necessary, apply some pads to adjust the participant's head position to ensure the forehead tightly positioned against the head coil.
- Ensure the participant does not cross their legs.
- Provide the participant with the emergency button and explain that they can press it in case of an emergency.
#### Adjust the scanner before send the subject inside
- Twist the knob to adjust the height of the bed and  wait for it to stop.
- Gently move the participant with the manual controls. Stop when the head is under the head-localizer. Instruct the participant to close his eyes.
- Turn on the red light to localize the head. Put one hand on the head coil, then turn the knob left or right to align the red light with the mark on the head coil. Once aligned, turn off the red light and instruct the participant to open their eyes.
- Turn off the ventilation and set the scanner light to the minimum level.
- SSend the participant into the scanner, then proceed to the console at the back of scanner.
#### Adjust the lens of eye tracker
- Point the lens of eye tracker towards the participant's right eye.
- <mark>[Add the default position of the lens for convenient adjustment]</mark>
- Rotate the lens until the pupil is in focus on the screen during camera mode. Adjust until the image is sharp, with both the pupil and eyelashes well defined.

## ET Calibration
#### Inform the participant
Inform the participant that you are leaving the room and will shortly come back for a final preparation.
#### Open psychopy in the psychopy laptop. 
If you are connecting the eye tracker to the experimental laptop for the first time, you will need to configure it (see Section 0).
#### Run the experiment on psychopy
Click the `Run Experiment` button, or run the experiment from the terminal by typing:
`python experiment.py`
  
!!! important "Make sure that once the experiment start after the calibration, the data are being stored to the xx.EDF file. There should be a message about that displayed <mark>at the ET’s PC screen</mark>. <mark>(According to Helene's, but we did not notice there was such message popping out before)</mark>"

#### Run the calibration
Once the stimulation begins, follow the messages on the screen to run the calibration, make sure the following options are selected correctly

- Calibration Type: `5 points calibration`
- Sampling rate: `1k`
- Tracking mode: `Pupil-CR`
- Pupil Tracking: `Ellipse`
- Camera Position: `Right`"

#### Apply threshold to find the pupil
- On the ET PC, click `Apply Threshold` (top left corner, as shown in the figure below). Ensure that the pupil is detected and that you see the blue cross on the eye. If you encounter issues, check the lighting inside the scanner (ensure it's not too bright or too dim) and verify the participant's position inside the coil. Once the calibration starts, accept the calibration points when they turn green by clicking `Accept Fixation`.
- If the calibration was successful, you will see the sentence `calibration successful` at the bottom in green. Check the stability of the accepted points and overall score of the calibration. 
!!!tip "If the calibration points form a cross, it is the perfect calibration."
![](../assets/debi_protocol/selected/16-e-good-cross.jpg){: style="width: 80%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}
 
#### Follow up with the validation. 
!!! tip "What you should see in an ideal situation is: the reference dot on the center of the screen and another dot that corresponds to the pupil calibration. The calibration dot is more or less stable moving a little around the reference dot."
!!! warning "If the calibration dot is unstable and is moving around far from the reference dot, the experimenter should go back clicking the restart button, adjust the contrast and redo the calibration. Once the calibration dot is quite stable, proceed with the validation clicking the accept fixation."

![](../assets/debi_protocol/selected/18-e-validation.jpg){: style="width: 80%;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}
#### Go into the scanner room and inform the participant
  Inform the participant that you are leaving the room and will now close the door to start. Let them also know that you are going to communicate with them very shortly to check that communications through the speaker are functioning.
#### Exit the Scanning Room.
#### Close the Scanning Room door.
## Running the scanning session
### Run the Experiment
- At the end of the ET calibration we are ready to run the experiment.
- Wait for the sentence “In this task you will see a color dot. Please keep your eyes on the fixation point. The program is ready for the scanner trigger. Press s to proceed manually.”
  
!!! important "Due to the upgrade of the scanner, it cannot immediately start the acquisition after receives the trigger signal from the syncbox. Thus, we need to extract the temporal information of the scanner and ET respectively. In order to make such post-processing easier, we need to first start the acquisition, and then the eye tracker. Thus, the first trigger recorded in the pmu in the raw data will be exactly the same trigger that starts the eye tracker."

!!! danger "The order: start of scanner -> press the button of syncbox is important and cannot be exchanged."

- Now two people need to get ready beside the syncbox and the scanner.
- One person first start the scanner acquisition.
- Then, another person press  `start session` on the sync box clicking the round button. 
- The stimulation will start with the ET recording. 


### Acquire a high-resolution anatomical image
