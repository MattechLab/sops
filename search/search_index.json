Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven to be a valuable, non-invasive tool for examining both the architecture and activity of the brain in vivo. Despite significant mathematical and computational advances in reconstructing resonance signals, most studies rely on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using echo-planar imaging (EPI). This method employs Cartesian sampling and image reconstruction with a direct one-to-one correspondence between the number of acquired volumes and reconstructed images. However, EPI techniques face trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolutions. In this project, we aim to overcome these limitations by measuring the BOLD signal using a gradient recalled echo (GRE) with a 3D radial-spiral phyllotaxis trajectory at a high sampling rate. This approach allows the reconstruction of 3D signal time courses with whole-brain coverage, achieving simultaneously higher spatial (1 mm\u00b3) and temporal (up to 250 ms) resolutions compared to optimized EPI schemes. Additionally, artifacts are corrected before image reconstruction, and the desired temporal resolution can be selected post-scan without assumptions about the hemodynamic response shape. In total, each protocol involves MRI/fMRI acquisition from 20 healthy adult human subjects using three different 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI scanners available at CHUV.</p>"},{"location":"#impact","title":"Impact","text":"<p>Overall, this project will introduce a new framework for acquiring and analyzing fMRI data, addressing many of the current limitations. This method represents a significant advancement in functional BOLD imaging and has the potential to fundamentally redefine the research questions fMRI can address regarding cognitive processes. The project will publicly release valuable datasets that are essential for enhancing the acquisition and analysis of functional resonance data. In conclusion, this study is poised to be a turning point for MRI research in both neuroscientific and clinical applications.</p>"},{"location":"data-collection/","title":"Data collection","text":""},{"location":"data-collection/#example-1","title":"Example 1","text":"<p>The following is an example checklist for setting up a participant in the MRI to avoid motion-related or foreign object-related artifacts:</p> <p>BEFORE SCAN DATE</p> <ul> <li> Confirm that participant does not have any MRI contraindications</li> <li> Remind participant that any jewelry should be removed prior to the scan </li> <li> If allowed to wear street clothes, remind participant to avoid clothing with metal or that would uncomfortable to lie in for the duration of the scan</li> <li> If participant has indicated nervousness or history of claustrophobia, utilize mock scanner </li> </ul> <p>DAY OF SCAN, PRIOR TO PARTICIPANT ARRIVAL</p> <ul> <li> Prepare consent documents and MRI safety screener </li> <li> Prepare scrubs and MR-compatible glasses if applicable</li> <li> Setup scanner bed with proper headcoil, under-knee padding, neck padding, and any other padding necessary for safety and comfort </li> <li> Check stimulus display and response device </li> </ul> <p>SCAN TIME</p> <ul> <li> Have participant fill out consent documents and MRI safety screener, and verbally confirm responses, paying attention to frequently forgotten devices and implants, like orthodontia</li> <li> Have participant empty their pockets or change into scrubs, and remove all jewelry/hair accessories and check for any missed metallic objects with the scan center\u2019s preferred method</li> <li> Instruct participant on staying still and encourage them to request breaks if necessary </li> <li> Solicit feedback on participant\u2019s comfort while positioning them on the scanner bed and suggest ergonomic positioning of arms to avoid discomfort</li> <li> Follow the Scan console checklist.</li> </ul> <p>DURING SCAN</p> <ul> <li> Check in with participant frequently</li> <li> Watch for motion if you can see the participant, or use motion monitoring equipment</li> </ul> <p>AFTER SCAN</p> <ul> <li> Solicit more feedback on participant\u2019s comfort for future sessions</li> <li> Run MRIQC to evaluate data</li> </ul>"},{"location":"data-collection/#example-2","title":"Example 2","text":"<p>BEFORE THE SCAN DATE (1-2 days)</p> <ul> <li> Call or email the participant before the appointment to remind them of the details and times, and confirm that they can still make it</li> <li> Register their confirmation in STRATA or reschedule the appointment (see scheduling SOPs).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"data-collection/data-collection_DEBI_protocol/","title":"DEBI protocol","text":"Note for writers <ul> <li>Precisely point out what is connected to what by which kind of cables.</li> <li>Need double check with JB</li> </ul>"},{"location":"data-collection/data-collection_DEBI_protocol/#overall-experimental-setting","title":"Overall experimental setting","text":"<p>The experimental setting is to obtain anatomical MRI scan with synchronized eye tracking recording (the right eye gaze trajectories and eye movement events including blinking, saccades and fixation).</p> <p>Here is the illustration of the overall experiment:</p> <p></p> <p>The graph above can be divided into the following components: - Syncbox: A NordicLabs Syncbox sends TTL (transistor-transistor logic) triggers to the scanner and forward the signal converted to the keyboard signal \"s\" to the PsychoPy laptop. </p> <p></p> <p>Trigger to PsychoPy PC</p> <p></p> <p>Trigger to Scanner</p> <ul> <li>Scanner: 3T clinical scanner (MAGNETOM PrismaFit, Siemens Healthineers) with a 64-channel head-neck coil with an attached mirror.</li> <li>Eye tracker: We use the EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research Ltd.) for eye tracking.

The first type is anatomical imaging that we use to study the morphology of the brain. The second type is a functional MRI, which we use to understand how the brain activates as a response to stimuli we will present to you. During the whole duration of the exam, please do not create closed loops by crossing your legs or holding your hands together. It is possible that your peripheral nerves get stimulated at some points, so you will feel twitching of muscles, for instance, of your pectorals. Do not panic, it is okay, but if it feels too uncomfortable, please squeeze the alarm button.For the anatomical MRI we just ask you to relax and try to stay as still and comfortable as possible. Like a photographic camera, the largest problem making analyses difficult is motion. As opposed to a photo camera, the imaging of the brain happens very slow so there is a lot of opportunity for involuntary movements (e.g., when you blink or you take a deeper breath) or semi-voluntary (e.g., you need to swallow).   During the functional MRI you will hear different sounds in the headphones. The audio stimulation consists of short sounds of objects of everyday life (es for example, the sound of vacuum cleaner, the crying of a child, a guitar song, a bell rings, etc.) or animal noises. The experimental protocol consists of 15s audio stimulation using the above tracks followed by 25s of pauses in which we provided a pink noise. For the entire period of the experiment you should takes the eye open on a fixation point (a red cross) at the center of a gray environment. The experiment has a duration of 40 minutes more and less.</p> <p>*Is everything clear to you?
